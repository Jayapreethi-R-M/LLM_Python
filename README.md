# LLM_Python

Hello! Thank you for visiting my repository.

This project contains the code for a Python-based QA (Question-Answer) system that I developed to assist students in their research and academic writing process.

I built the application using PyCharm and integrated the Groq API (used the LLaMA3-70b-8192 model) to integrate its AI capabilities. To create a user-friendly interface, I used Streamlit to design and deploy the front end.

âœ¨ Project Overview
The LLM model itself helps students in the academic writing process. The LLM has four key functionalities:

Grammar Check - Students can paste their text into the platform, and the AI will provide grammar corrections and writing improvement suggestions.

Topic Generator - By entering an area of study, users get five specific research topics and ideas to guide their writing process.

Research Helper - Students can ask research-related questions and get concise, well-structured paragraph responses to aid their understanding.

Citation Generator - Users can input relevant information about academic papers, and the AI will generate citations in both APA and MLA formats.
